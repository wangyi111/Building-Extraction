# Building -Extraction

This repository contains several implementation demos of deep learning based building extraction with tensorflow.

1. [**Single-pixel based segmentation**](./0-old/): simple CNN & Residual Network.

2. [**Fully convolutional network**](./1-FCN/), based on the paper [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html).

3. [**U-Net**](./2-U-Net/), based on the paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).

4. [**Modified U-Net**](./3-Modified-UNet/), based on the paper [BRRNet: A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1050).
